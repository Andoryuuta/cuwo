cuwo is an open server implementation for Cube World, and includes various
utilities to manipulate its data.

Status
======

Right now, cuwo has a working MITM server that can inject chat packets. However,
to create a complete server, the protocol has to be dissected completely, which
is still WIP.

There is also a working Cube World/Qubicle model converter. Find it in the 
'tools' folder.
